# predicting-climate-beliefs

This project trains models that predict county-level climate beliefs, as defined by the percentage of people in a county who respond "yes" to 
### (1) "Do you support setting CO2 limits on coal-fired power plants?" 
### (2) "Are you worried about climate change?", and 
### (3) "Do you believe climate change will harm the US?"
using data from prior years (i.e. if predicting for 2016, use data from 2015 and before)
